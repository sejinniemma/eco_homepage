  I like English and I like new experiences, so as a developer, not only in Korea,
  
  I wanted to be a developer who could work abroad.
  So I applied for a co-up visa to go to Canada and build a career as a developer.
  It was a time to seriously think about what kind of life I want to live as a developer in another new country alone.
  Even if it was not a company, I thought that I wanted to become a valuable and capable person as a developer and become a person who could work on the stage around the world.
  So, I will study English continuously, not neglecting development studies, and open up more opportunities for me
  I wanted to.
  In conclusion, I want to challenge myself and work wherever I want without complacency.`;
