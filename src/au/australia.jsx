  It was my first independence from my parents' fence. It was a working holiday in Australia.
  I found myself in a new environment, hanging out with people from various countries I saw for the first time.
  For me, this experience is "who I really am,".
  I got a very important experience and a great realization in life.
  I was always a person who felt the greatest sense of accomplishment and satisfaction in life when I was constantly learning and growing up
  I was very curious about new culture and language experiences.
  Before that, if I was attracted by the surrounding eyes and chose, I could choose everything with my own subjectivity through my experience in Australia.
  As I got to know myself, I naturally made a choice about my job
  It is also a place that made me dream of becoming a developer.`;
